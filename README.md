## QuickLyrics

<p>For our project we decided to create a page where you could quickly look up lyrics to your favorite song.</p>

<p>Not only will you be able to view the lyrics to any approved song, you will be able to also view a picture of the artist and view the album from which the song is from if applicable.</p>

<p>Included in the song information area is a button to be able to view the biography of the selected artist, which will appear above the lyrics.</p>

<p>With our lyric feature you will need to know the name of the artist as well as the song title which needs to be entered in correctly.</p>

<p>Listed below are some screenshots of what to expect when using our page.</p>
